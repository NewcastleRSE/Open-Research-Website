        Peer review of study protocols with analysis plans, along with
        dissemination of findings regardless of outcome, addresses publication
        bias against null results. It also provides the benefits of
        preregistration by making a clearer distinction between hypothesis tests
        and discovery research. By submitting funded studies to journals as a
        registered report, the scientist improves study planning, increases
        study rigor, and improves scientific credibility. Funders who support
        this process anticipate that peer-review feedback could change study
        processes that result in budget changes and are prepared to consider
        such amendments in response to journal reviewer feedback.
