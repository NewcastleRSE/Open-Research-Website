        Preprints allow research findings to be quickly and easily available to
        all and allows researchers to claim priority of discovery, receive
        community input, and demonstrate evidence of progress for funders and
        others. They are posted in a repository or preprint server that codifies
        free, unrestricted, and perpetual access to the preprint ahead of peer
        review and formal publication. Preprints should be posted in a timely
        manner, ideally at the time of first submission to a journal.
